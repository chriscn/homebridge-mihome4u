# homebridge-mihome4u
A fast up to date homebridge plugin to interface properly with [MiHome](https://mihome4u.co.uk) using the API.

###### Scripts
Below are scripts just so that I don't forget them.
- `npm run build` - Build's the TS to JS
- `npm publish' - Publish to NPM
- `npm link` - Allows homebridge to find it
- `npm run watch` - Automatic development and restarting :-)
